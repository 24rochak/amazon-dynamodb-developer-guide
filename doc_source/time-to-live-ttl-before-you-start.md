# Before You Begin Using Time to Live<a name="time-to-live-ttl-before-you-start"></a>

 Before you enable Time to Live \(TTL\) on an Amazon DynamoDB table, consider the following: 
+ Ensure that any existing timestamp values in the specified Time to Live attribute are correct and in the right format\. TTL attributes must use the `Number` data type, and values must use the Unix epoch time format\.
+ Items with no TTL attribute, or with an expiration time more than 5 years in the past, are not deleted\.
+ If data recovery is a concern, we recommend that you back up your table\.
  + For a 24\-hour recovery window, you can use Amazon DynamoDB Streams\. For more information, see [DynamoDB Streams and Time to Live](time-to-live-ttl-streams.md)\.
  + For a full backup, you can use on\-demand backups or point\-in\-time recovery\. For more information, see [On\-Demand Backup and Restore for DynamoDB](BackupRestore.md) and [Point\-in\-Time Recovery for DynamoDB](PointInTimeRecovery.md)\.
+  You can set Time to Live when creating a DynamoDB table using AWS CloudFormation\. For more information, see the [AWS CloudFormation User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-dynamodb-table.html)\. 
+ You can use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policies to prevent unauthorized updates to the TTL attribute or configuration of the Time to Live feature\. If you only allow access to specified actions in your existing IAM policies, ensure that your policies are updated to allow `dynamodb:UpdateTimeToLive` for roles that need to enable or disable Time to Live on tables\. For more information, see [Using Identity\-Based Policies \(IAM Policies\) for Amazon DynamoDB](using-identity-based-policies.md)\.
+ Consider whether you need to do any post\-processing of deleted items\. The streams records of TTL deletes are marked, and you can monitor them using an AWS Lambda function\. For more information about the additions to the streams record, see [DynamoDB Streams and Time to Live](time-to-live-ttl-streams.md)\.
