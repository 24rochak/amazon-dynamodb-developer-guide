Amazon DynamoDB provides low\-level API actions for managing database tables and indexes, and for creating, reading, updating and deleting data\. DynamoDB also provides API actions for accessing and processing stream records\.

**Note**  
This API Reference describes the low\-level API for Amazon DynamoDB\. Instead of making requests to the low\-level API directly from your application, we recommend that you use one of the AWS Software Development Kits \(SDKs\) for your programming language\. The AWS SDKs take care of request authentication, serialization, and connection management\. For more information, see [Overview of AWS SDK Support for DynamoDB](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Programming.SDKOverview.html) in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide\.

 At the end of each API action description there are links to the equivalent CLI command and programming\-specific language method\. Similarly, at the end of each API datatype description, there are links to the equivalent programming\-specific language type\.
